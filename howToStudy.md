Gatsby, a React static site generator that lets you get all the benefits of React without any of the downsides.
* A pre-configured Webpack, meaning you get all the benefits without any of the headaches.
* Automatic routing based on your directory structure.
* All HTML content is also generated server-side, so you get the best of both worlds. 
* Static content means no server and super-easy hosting on GitHub Pages.
