#### Week 5
* Learn Redux (Wes Bos FREE)

#### Week 6
* Learn GraphQL  
GraphQL itself is just a protocol, but its best implementation right now is probably the Apollo library, which works well with Redux. There is still a lack of instructiona* l material around GraphQL and Apollo, but hopefully the Apollo documentation can help you get started.

**Gatsby**, a React static site generator that lets you get all the benefits of React without any of the downsides.
* A pre-configured Webpack, meaning you get all the benefits without any of the headaches.
* Automatic routing based on your directory structure.
* All HTML content is also generated server-side, so you get the best of both worlds. 
* Static content means no server and super-easy hosting on GitHub Pages.
