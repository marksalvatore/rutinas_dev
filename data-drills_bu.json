[{"id":"drill-f1","title":"Drill #1 - Cut Shot","category":"fundamentals","rules":"Start with the cue ball (CB) in position 4. Each time you pocket the object ball (OB), advance the CB one position (e.g., from 4 to 5); and with each miss, move down by one number (e.g., from 4 to 3). If you succeed at position 7 or miss at position 1, stay at that position. The phrase progressive practice is used to describe this type of drill because the difficulty level changes progressively in response to your performance. + Continue for 10 shots total. + Adjust the CB position after the 10th shot based on the outcome, but not below 1 or above 7. + For example if you make the 10th shot at 6, the final position is 7; and if you miss the 10th shot at 6, the final position is 5. + Any drill in this exam can be done from the other side of the table (e.g., if it is easier to reach for a left-handed vs. right-handed player).","scoring":"Your score for the drill is the final position number plus a bonus for excellence. The bonus is equal to the numbers of successes at position 7. The maximum total score allowed is 10. score = CB position number after the last shot + bonus (10 max)","url":"https://pad.chalkysticks.com/c74b4.svg"},
{"id":"drill-f2","title":"Drill #2 - Stop Shot","category":"fundamentals","rules":"Follow the instructions from drill F1. The OB must be pocketed, and the stopped CB must overlap at least part of the ghost-ball (GB) outline. The CB is allowed to contact the cushion. Tap and mark both the OB and GB positions with little white donuts to make it easier to check GB overlap after each shot (e.g., by trying to place a ball in the GB position) and to re-spot the OB. You are allowed to vary the CB and OB positions away from the rail as long as the CB remains within one diamond of the rail. If you end up in position 1 you are allowed to place the CB anywhere between positions 1 and 2. This will allow you to comfortably avoid a double hit.","scoring":"Your score for the drill is the final position number plus a bonus for excellence.

{"id":"f5","title":"Drill #5 - Stun Shot","category":"fundamentals","rules":"The OB must be pocketed and the CB must end up within or overlapping the target for success. + Start with the target in position 4. Note that the target center and orientation for position 4 is different from the others, with the long edge against the rail cushion. The target centers for the other positions are aligned with the long-rail diamonds. + The CB must head straight to the target (without cushion contact) for positions 1, 2, and 3, and the CB must rebound off the end rail for target positions 5, 6, and 7. Cushion contact is allowed, but not required, for target position 4. + With each success, advance the target one position (e.g., from 4 to 5); and with each miss, move the target back (e.g., from 4 to 3). If you succeed at position 7 or miss at position 1, keep the target at that position. + Continue for 10 shots total. + Adjust the target position after the 10th shot based on the outcome, but not below 1 or above 7.
